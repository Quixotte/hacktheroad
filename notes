= Challenge - Why?
-
Drivers are not achieving maximum efficiency due to lack of knowledge about their optimal speed.
-
Cars accelerate/deaccelerate one after another, causing the //harmonica// effect we all know.
-
Drivers are not aware of the right speed to hit green lights.

= Solution - How?
-
Lead the driver with (an additional) tail light of other drivers.
-
With a banner: simply some lights, wired to emit a bright green when that car is near the front of the 'green wave'.
-
This communicates to the driver behind it to tail that vehicle, closing gaps and naturally forming neat 'pelotons' of cars.
-
The light can be either bought by, or handed out to, drivers to be put in the back of their cars, visible for drivers behind them.
-
To be effective, only a small percentage of the people will need to participate.
-
The one simple rule to explain to people is to try to get as close to the head of the green wave as possible (if there is space of course).
-
Coax drivers into riding in neat pelotons that are overlapping with the green wave.
-
With proper communication between driver and iVRIs, the flow of traffic would be improved, especially in iVRI-heavy areas.
-
Make a smart connected communication device to clearly communicate to other drivers what the optimal flow is.
-
The device itself is rather simple: a light we call the 'banner'.
This banner communicates to drivers behind it with a green color that it is travelling optimally.
Therefore, simply staying behind this car optimizes the flow.

= Implementation - What?
-
There are several different components required for the solution.
-
'Time to green' for the next light must be known.
The speed, direction and intended route of the car with the banner.
-

= Closing out
Here's our catchy slogan: Wees geen oen, blijf achter groen!

= Bonus
For drivers who don't want the banner in their car: the 'green wave' data will be made freely available so that google, apple, tomtom, webmobile, etc. can use it in their routing applications.
It will be available in 2 formats: either as time-to-green times of traffic signals and nothing more,
as map-overlayable data, with the speed required along the path, for easy integration for anyone.
-
Drivers using those apps can be psychologically rewarded by informing them of their time and fuel/money saved.
-
Autonomous cars can use the data to prefer riding (at the start of) green waves,
automatically causing drivers following them to also be part of those.
-
There is a green wave even when drivers have been waiting in traffic.
When the line is long enough, some car will not pass the green light.
The lights of cars can communicate this to that (poor) driver.

= Potential issues
When lanes split up right in front of signals, the green wave can only be turned on when both are green, despite drivers sharing a lane beforehand.
Also, in these cases, care must be taken not to drive slower than allowed.
